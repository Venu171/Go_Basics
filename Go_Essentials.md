# Go Essentials

**1.Module Introduction**
- __Values, Basic Types & Core Language Features__
   - Understanding the **Key Components** of Go Program
   - Working with **Values and Types**
   - Creating & Executing **Functions**
   - Controlling Execution with **Control Structures**

**2.Working with Functions and Values**
   - The __package__ clause is called the **top of file**  in go.Without this clause the GO program would cause the *error* saying the program should start with **package clause error**.
   - For every go project we need to enter this `go mod init <directory_name>`.

**3.Organize Code with Packages.**
   - Because **main** is the special, reserved package name that tells Go to build this file as an executable program â€” and to look for a **main() function** as the **entry point** of execution.
   - The main package is speacial and entry point to execution of program and every other file is named as per user's essence.
   - Go is all about modules.
